# Devops-Project1
Devops is a career field for IT student
We satrted with docker installation
Opened account with github
Insvtalled gitbash
Created first repository, which is the one we're currently working on
Now we moved to how to add files into repository either by dragging or by addingfiles from gitbash
Also, we worked on how to work on gitbash and send it directly to the repository folder on github
This is the status of my progress for a stater.
